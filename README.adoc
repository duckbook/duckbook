Some notes from debates with conspiracy theorists.

== Requirements

- asciidoctor
- ruby2.1
- bundler
- GNU make

Theoretically everything should work with asciidoc, but asciidoctor is used for dependency discovery in the build system.

== Structure

assets:: any media that isn't text and might potentially be used from a few locations
    meta;; assets related to the description of the document itself
    xkcd;; comic images from http://xkcd.com/[xkcd]
output:: results from document compilation
papers:: a store for academic papers (if you have them)
